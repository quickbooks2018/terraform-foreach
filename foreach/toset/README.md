# toset
Let's break down this line of code to understand how it works:
hclCopyName = var.vpc_names[index(var.vpc_cidrs, each.value)]
This line is assigning a name to each VPC based on the corresponding index of its CIDR block in the original list. Let's dissect it step by step:

each.value:

In the context of the for_each = toset(var.vpc_cidrs), each.value represents the current CIDR block being processed in the loop.


index(var.vpc_cidrs, each.value):

The index() function finds the position of a given element in a list.
var.vpc_cidrs is the original list of CIDR blocks.
each.value is the current CIDR block.
This function returns the index (position) of the current CIDR block in the original list.


var.vpc_names[...]:

var.vpc_names is the list of VPC names provided.
The [...] syntax is used to access an element in the list by its index.



Putting it all together:

For each unique CIDR block (ensured by toset), we find its original position in the vpc_cidrs list.
We then use that position to select the corresponding name from the vpc_names list.

This approach ensures that even if toset removes duplicate CIDRs, we still assign the correct name to each VPC based on its original position in the input list.
Here's an example to illustrate:
hclCopyvpc_cidrs = ["10.0.0.0/16", "10.1.0.0/16", "10.0.0.0/16", "10.2.0.0/16"]
vpc_names = ["VPC1", "VPC2", "VPC3", "VPC4"]
After toset processes vpc_cidrs, we effectively have:
hclCopyunique_cidrs = ["10.0.0.0/16", "10.1.0.0/16", "10.2.0.0/16"]
For each of these:

"10.0.0.0/16" : index() returns 0, so it gets the name "VPC1"
"10.1.0.0/16" : index() returns 1, so it gets the name "VPC2"
"10.2.0.0/16" : index() returns 3, so it gets the name "VPC4"

This method allows us to maintain the correlation between CIDRs and names even when duplicates are removed, ensuring that each unique VPC gets its intended name.
